Analysis

Task 0:
Time Complexity - O(1)
This exercise only require access to a specific value in array. So, no matter the size of the input, it only executes one line.

Task 1:
O(len(calls) and len(texts)) is O(n),O(n) is the worst case,Adding each phone no. to set is O(1),Total time complexity is O(n)

Task 2:
There is one for loop which depends on the input size n which has been called 1 times so for loop complexity is O(n) and the print statement. So the Overall Time Complexity for worst Case is O(n)

Task 3:
Time Complexity - O(nlog(n))
It is super-linear time because even though it has for-loops that 
are dependant on the input,iterating from 1 to n, resulting in O(n); it also has 
a sorting function which is 0(nlogn). Combining these two results in 0(n + nlogn). 
The time complexity can be simplified to O(nlog(n))
   
Task 4:
O(nlogn) is the worst case,Inside for loop all are constant oprations,Sorting List is O(nlogn) 
For both the fraud_numbers, non_fraud_numbers is O(n)
Itration of calls is O(n)
Difference and intersection between both is O(n)
Total time complexity is O(nlogn)
